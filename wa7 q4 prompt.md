Provide the state diagram for a Turing machine that, on input x ∈ {0, 1}<sup>+</sup>, replaces x with x 1’s. Here, we are thinking of x as a binary number. For example, 1001 would be replaced with 111111111, while 00 is replaced with with all blanks. Simulate your solution using the online Turing machine simulator and provide an in-class demo that includes an explanation of your algorithm.
